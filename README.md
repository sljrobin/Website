### 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the Internet

### 🔎 For the most curious amongst you
* Behind the hood, as a site generator, I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with several tasks in a [Rakefile](https://ruby.github.io/rake/doc/rakefile_rdoc.html) to automate a few things
* In terms of design, I created a [short CSS](./assets/css/style.css). The CSS skeleton is using [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as well as the minimalist framework [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)
* Readability was improved with a [tiny Javascript](./assets/js/scroll.js)
* For the final touch of creativity, I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with the [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro), [Goudy Bookletter 1911](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goudy+Bookletter+1911), and [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script) fonts
